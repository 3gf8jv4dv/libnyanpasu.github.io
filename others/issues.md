# Q&A Convention

### I don't want to fill out the Issue Template, can I just create a new Blank Issue submission?

No, you can't. Issues that do not follow the Issue Template will be closed!

### Can I create an Issue that has nothing to do with issue feedback/feature requests?

No, you can't. Please feel free to follow the guidelines and go to Discussion to discuss other types of topics!

### Can I discuss topics unrelated to an Issue in a single Issue?

No. As a rule, only a single issue should be discussed in a single Issue; if there are issues related to this Issue, you can mention other Issues.

Also, please don't reply to issues that have nothing to do with the topic of the issue.

### Can I express my emotions in an Issue?

No, you can't. I think this is something you need to think about.

### Other Issues

### This app is great, is there a way to donate?

Sorry, this project does not passively accept donations of any kind.

### This app is great, can I share it with social networks in mainland China?

No, please keep a low profile.

### Does it accept airport (or any other type of advertisement) promotion?

No, I personally (keiko233) hate advertisements.

### What is the significance of this project?

If you're careful, you'll notice that this project has been around since before many Clash projects were discontinued, and it was initially intended for my (keiko233) own use, but some of the PRs I submitted to Verge were not accepted (merged) for unknown reasons. So I forked a copy and changed it for my own use, and I have nothing to do with what happened after that.
